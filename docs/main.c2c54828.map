In Dexie v1.4.0, I've rewritten the Promise class entirely. Just some fragments of promise-light is left. I use\n// another strategy now that simplifies everything a lot: to always execute callbacks in a new micro-task, but have an own micro-task\n// engine that is indexedDB compliant across all browsers.\n// Promise class has also been optimized a lot with inspiration from bluebird - to avoid closures as much as possible.\n// Also with inspiration from bluebird, asyncronic stacks in debug mode.\n//\n// Specific non-standard features of this Promise class:\n// * Custom zone support (a.k.a. PSD) with ability to keep zones also when using native promises as well as\n//   native async / await.\n// * Promise.follow() method built upon the custom zone engine, that allows user to track all promises created from current stack frame\n//   and below + all promises that those promises creates or awaits.\n// * Detect any unhandled promise in a PSD-scope (PSD.onunhandled). \n//\n// David Fahlander, https://github.com/dfahlander\n//\n\n// Just a pointer that only this module knows about.\n// Used in Promise constructor to emulate a private constructor.\nvar INTERNAL = {};\n\n// Async stacks (long stacks) must not grow infinitely.\nconst\n    LONG_STACKS_CLIP_LIMIT = 100,\n    // When calling error.stack or promise.stack, limit the number of asyncronic stacks to print out. \n    MAX_LONG_STACKS = 20,\n    ZONE_ECHO_LIMIT = 7,\n    nativePromiseInstanceAndProto = (()=>{\n        try {\n            // Be able to patch native async functions\n            return new Function(`let F=async ()=>{},p=F();return [p,Object.getPrototypeOf(p),Promise.resolve(),F.constructor];`)();\n        } catch(e) {\n            var P = _global.Promise;\n            return P ?\n                [P.resolve(), P.prototype, P.resolve()] :\n                []; \n        }\n    })(),\n    resolvedNativePromise = nativePromiseInstanceAndProto[0],\n    nativePromiseProto = nativePromiseInstanceAndProto[1],\n    resolvedGlobalPromise = nativePromiseInstanceAndProto[2],\n    nativePromiseThen = nativePromiseProto && nativePromiseProto.then;\n\nexport const NativePromise = resolvedNativePromise && resolvedNativePromise.constructor;\nexport const AsyncFunction = nativePromiseInstanceAndProto[3];\nconst patchGlobalPromise = !!resolvedGlobalPromise;\n\nvar stack_being_generated = false;\n\n/* The default function used only for the very first promise in a promise chain.\n   As soon as then promise is resolved or rejected, all next tasks will be executed in micro ticks\n   emulated in this module.
